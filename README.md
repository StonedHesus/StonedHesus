- 👋 Hullo, I’m @StonedHesus, but in the real world I go by Paul.
- 🌍 I speak 🇬🇧, 🇫🇷, 🇩🇪, 🇷🇴, 🇷🇺
- 🇫🇷 I am currently a student in Paris, at the IRIF, which is one of the research institutes belonging to the Université Paris Cité. I am also a member of the Academy of Political Sciences of Paris, nowadays known as SciencesPo.
- 📚 My interests are programming languages and their conception, game development, algorithmic, networking, and ethical hacking.
- 🚀 I am currently working on improving my overall skillset as a programmer, becoming a polyglot in different languages, utilising and assimilating easily different paradigms, APIs, frameworks, solving standard problems and finding broader applications for them, applying computer science to humanities, with a focus on data journalism and social sciences, and lastly (pff you still here, for I am tired, time for a tea break *slurps*) learning OCaml, Lua, Löve2D, and Scala.
